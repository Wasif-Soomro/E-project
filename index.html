          </p>
          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>Game Setup
            Shuffle the deck and deal 7 cards to each player.
            Place the remaining cards face down (Draw Pile).
            Flip the top card to start a Discard Pile (if it's an action card, follow the effect).
            Game Play
            The first player (left of the dealer) matches the top card on the discard pile by color or number.
            If a player doesn't have a matching card, they must draw from the deck:
            If they can play the drawn card, they may.
            If not, they skip their turn.
            Use Action Cards strategically to block or punish opponents.
            Call "UNO" when you have one card left:
            If another player catches you not saying "UNO" before your next turn, you draw 2 extra cards.
            The round continues until one player plays their last card.
          </p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>Must match color or number unless playing a Wild card.
            You can't play a Wild Draw Four unless you have no playable cards of the current color.
            Stacking Penalties: Official rules don't allow stacking Draw Two or Draw Four cards (house rules may vary).
            If the Draw Pile is empty, reshuffle the Discard Pile.
            A player can challenge a Wild Draw Four if they think it was played unfairly. If the challenger is correct,
            the other player draws 4 cards instead.

          </p>
          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>The first player removes one block from any row below the top using one hand.
            Place the block on top of the tower in the same crisscross pattern.
            Players take turns removing and stacking blocks without making the tower fall.
            The game continues until a player causes the tower to collapse.
            The last successful player before the collapse is the winner.
          </p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>Only one hand can be used at a time to remove blocks.
            Players must take a turn; skipping is not allowed.
            Only touch one block at a time—once you move a block, you must take it.
            The new block must be stacked on top before the next player’s turn.
            The game ends when the tower falls (even if only one block falls).

          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>The first player/team throws the pallino to begin the round.
            The same player/team throws the first bocce ball, trying to land close to the pallino.
            The opposing team then throws a bocce ball, trying to get closer than the first ball.
            The team furthest from the pallino keeps throwing until they are closest or run out of balls.
            Once all bocce balls are thrown, the round ends, and points are scored.
            The team who scored last starts the next round by throwing the pallino.
          </p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>Players must stay behind the throwing line when tossing.
            Bocce balls must be underhand thrown.
            The pallino must land at least halfway down the court.
            If a bocce ball or pallino goes out of bounds, it is removed from play.
            Players can hit the pallino or opponent's balls to change positions.
            If teams cannot determine the closest ball, a measuring device is used.

          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>Players take turns rolling two dice and move their token forward the total number of spaces. If they land
            on an unowned property, they can buy it from the bank, but if it is owned by another player, they must pay
            rent to the owner. Players can buy houses and hotels to increase rent and trade properties with others. When
            landing on Chance or Community Chest spaces, they must draw a card and follow the instructions. If a player
            lands on "Go to Jail," draws a "Go to Jail" card, or rolls three doubles in a row, they are sent to jail and
            can get out by paying a $50 fine, using a "Get Out of Jail Free" card, or rolling doubles. Each time a
            player passes GO, they collect $200. If a player runs out of money, they must sell houses, hotels, or
            mortgage properties, and if they still cannot pay, they are bankrupt and out of the game. The game ends when
            all but one player has gone bankrupt.
          </p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>No Free Money in the Center: There is no rule for placing money in the center for "Free Parking."
            Trading is Allowed: Players can exchange properties, money, or immunity from rent.
            Bank Auctions: If a player doesn’t buy a property they land on, the bank auctions it.
            Mortgaging: Players can mortgage properties for half their value but must pay 10% interest to lift the
            mortgage.
            Bankruptcy: When a player cannot pay rent, fines, or debt, they are eliminated.

            Solo Play: Some players play alone for practice or improvement.
          </p>
          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>Each player begins by drawing 7 tiles from the tile bag. The first player starts the game by placing a word
            across the center star square. On each turn, a player must place a word connecting to existing words,
            calculate the word score, and draw new tiles to maintain 7 tiles on their rack. Words must be found in an
            official dictionary, formed horizontally or vertically, and connected to previous words on the board. Each
            letter has a point value (e.g., "A" = 1, "Z" = 10), and bonus squares can increase scores: Double Letter
            (DL) doubles a letter’s score, Triple Letter (TL) triples a letter’s score, Double Word (DW) doubles the
            word’s score, and Triple Word (TW) triples the word’s score. If a player believes a word is invalid, they
            can challenge it using the dictionary. The game ends when no tiles remain and a player uses all their tiles,
            with the player holding the highest score declared the winner.</p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>No Proper Nouns: Names, brands, or places are not allowed.
            Using All 7 Tiles: If a player uses all their tiles in one turn, they get a 50-point bonus.
            Swapping Tiles: A player can choose to skip their turn and exchange tiles.
            Passing: Players can pass their turn if they can’t play a word.

          </p>
          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>A coin toss determines the first thrower. Players take turns throwing underhand from behind the foul line,
            with each player throwing all four bags before the next player takes their turn. Scoring is based on where
            the bag lands: 1 point if it stays on the board, 3 points if it goes through the hole, and 0 points if it
            lands off the board or bounces onto it. Cancellation scoring applies, meaning points cancel each other out;
            for example, if Team A scores 6 points (two bags in the hole) and Team B scores 4 points (one bag in the
            hole, one on the board), the final round score is 2 points for Team A (6 - 4 = 2). The first team to reach
            exactly 21 points wins, though an optional rule reduces a team's score to 15 if they exceed 21 points.</p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>Players must throw from behind the foul line.
            A bag that touches the ground first before landing on the board does not count.
            Players cannot remove bags from the board until the round is over.
            If a bag is knocked into the hole by another bag, it still counts as 3 points.
            In doubles, teammates cannot give advice or coach during play.

            Chess Variants: Some versions involve multiple players or teams, but standard chess is strictly a two-player
            game.
          </p>
          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>To play chess, each player begins with 16 pieces arranged on an 8x8 board, ensuring a light-colored square
            is in their bottom-right corner. White moves first, and players alternate turns, strategically moving their
            pieces to attack, defend, and control the board. The objective is to checkmate the opponent’s king by
            placing it in a position where it cannot escape capture. Each piece moves differently: the King moves one
            square in any direction but cannot move into check; the Queen moves any number of squares vertically,
            horizontally, or diagonally; the Rook moves in straight lines vertically or horizontally; the Bishop moves
            diagonally across the board; the Knight moves in an L-shape and can jump over other pieces; and the Pawn
            moves forward one square (or two on its first move) but captures diagonally. Pawns that reach the opponent’s
            back rank can be promoted to any piece except a King.</p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>Chess follows specific rules to maintain fair play. Players must move only their own pieces and cannot skip
            a turn. A player is in "check" if their King is attacked and must make a move to escape; if no legal moves
            exist to remove the check, it is "checkmate," and the game ends. A special move called "castling" allows the
            King and a Rook to move simultaneously under specific conditions for added safety. "En passant" is a unique
            Pawn capture rule, and "stalemate" occurs when a player has no legal moves but is not in check, resulting in
            a draw. The game can also end in a draw if insufficient material remains to checkmate, by threefold
            repetition of the same position, or if 50 moves pass without a Pawn move or capture. Understanding these
            rules ensures a strategic and fair game.</p>

            Maximum Players: Some versions allow up to 10 per team
            Casual Play: Any number of players can participate, as long as teams are balanced
          </p>
          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>Players are divided into two teams and positioned on opposite sides of the court, starting behind a
            designated line. Six dodgeballs are lined up in the center, and at the beginning ("Opening Rush"), players
            sprint to grab them. The objective is to eliminate opponents by throwing balls at them while avoiding being
            hit. Players can dodge incoming throws or catch a ball to eliminate the thrower and bring back a teammate.
            The game continues until one team is completely eliminated or time runs out.</p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>Players must throw from within their half of the court.
            If hit by a ball, a player is out unless the ball bounces first.
            Headshots do not count (depends on league rules).
            If a player catches a ball, the thrower is out, and the catching team gains a player back.
            Players can block a throw with a ball they are holding.
            Out of Bounds Rules
            Players must stay within their half of the court.
            If a player steps out of bounds, they are eliminated.
            Dead Ball Rule
            If a ball hits the floor, wall, or another surface before hitting a player, it does not count.

          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>Teams are divided evenly, with equal players on each side.
            The rope is placed at the center mark.
            Each team lines up on their side, holding the rope firmly.
            The referee signals the start (whistle or "Ready, Set, Pull!").
            Gameplay
            Players pull the rope toward their side using strength and teamwork.
            The goal is to pull the opposing team across the boundary line.
            The game continues until one team is pulled across the line or someone lets go of the rope.
          </p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>All players must hold the rope; no tying or looping around the body.
            No sitting or lying down while pulling.
            Hands must stay in their original position (no re-gripping).
            The team that pulls the center mark past their boundary line wins.
            The referee ensures fair play and stops the match if necessary.
            Fouls & Disqualifications
            Letting go of the rope intentionally results in a loss.
            Using unfair grips (tying the rope around hands or body) is not allowed.
            Dangerous pulling techniques (sudden jerks, twisting) can lead to disqualification.

            Logic Puzzles (Sudoku, Crosswords, Riddles)
            Read the problem carefully.
            Use deduction and reasoning to fill in missing pieces.
            Avoid contradictions; use trial and error if necessary.
            Complete the puzzle within the given rules.
            Word Puzzles (Scrabble, Anagrams, Word Search)
            Form words using given letters.
            Follow the word rules (Scrabble has a dictionary, crosswords use clues).
            Earn points by making longer or more complex words.

            The goal is to reach exactly 0 points.
            The last dart must land on a double or the bullseye.
            If a player scores more than needed, the turn is void (called a "Bust").
            The first player to reach 0 wins.

            Set a Hiding Area – Define clear boundaries (e.g., playground, house, backyard).
            Designate a Safe Zone – A "home base" where hiders can run to avoid being tagged.
            Gameplay
            The seeker closes their eyes and counts (e.g., from 10 to 50) while others hide.
            Hiders find a hiding spot before the seeker finishes counting.
            The seeker shouts "Ready or not, here I come!" and begins searching.
            The seeker finds and tags hiders one by one.
            If a hider reaches the safe zone without being tagged, they are safe.
            The game ends when all hiders are found or safe.
          </p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>The seeker must count aloud with their eyes closed.
            Hiders cannot change hiding spots after the seeker starts searching.
            The game continues until all hiders are found or a time limit is reached.
            No leaving the play area (players must hide within set boundaries).
            If a hider reaches the safe zone before being tagged, they are safe.

          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>Game Setup
            Two teams line up on opposite sides of the net.
            A coin toss decides which team serves first.
            Each team rotates players clockwise when they gain the serve.
            Basic Gameplay
            The server stands behind the baseline and serves the ball over the net.
            The receiving team must pass, set, and attack within 3 touches.
            The rally continues until:
            The ball lands on the ground (point to the other team).
            A team commits a foul or error.
            The team that wins a rally scores a point (Rally Scoring System).
            The first team to reach 25 points (win by 2) wins the set.
            If the game goes to a deciding set (5th set), it is played up to 15 points.
          </p>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <p>In volleyball, each team is allowed up to three touches per turn, including a pass, set, and attack, but no
            player can hit the ball twice in a row unless blocking. The ball must stay in play, go over the net within
            the boundary lines, and not touch the ground inside their court. Players rotate clockwise after winning a
            serve, and back-row players cannot attack from in front of the 3m line. Serves must be made from behind the
            baseline, and while the ball can touch the net, it must land in play; if it goes out of bounds, the opposing
            team earns a point. Fouls and violations include net touches, double hits, carrying/lifting the ball, and
            foot faults if the server steps on or over the baseline before serving. Following these rules ensures fair
            and competitive gameplay</p>
